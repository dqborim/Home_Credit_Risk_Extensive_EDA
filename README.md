# Home_Credit_Risk_Extensive_EDA
 
Description:
1st Notebook is an Extensive exploratory data analysis, features engineering and dimensionality reduction of the datasets from Home Credit Default Risk Kaggle Competition.
2nd Notebook gets the resulting new dataset of the first exploratory data analysis notebook and train, compare and combine machine learning models to be submited in the competition. (some models are computational expensive and take several minutes to execute)
 
What is inside:
This two notebooks contains an extensive exploratory data analysis and modeling of the datasets from the Home Credit Default Risk Kaggle Competition. Several data visualization, feature engineering, primary component analysis for dimensionality reduction, machine learning, ensemble modeling, learning curves and performance evaluation .
 
Instructions for the notebook:
Download the jupyter notebooks and images files into the same folder. Download all the datasets from Kaggle competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/data and save it into a new folder called Dataset together with the other files. Run the first notebook that will generate the new dataset csv file for the second notebook.
 
If there is problems rendering the notebook on github, try pasting the link into the nbviewer on jupyter website https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dqborim/Home_Credit_Risk_Extensive_EDA/blob/master/Home_Credit_Competition.ipynb.
